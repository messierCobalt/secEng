### HELLO ZEPP,

I want you to make a choice. There's a slow-acting poison coursing through your system, which only I have the antidote for. Will you read this and test these programs, to save yourself?

Listen carefully, if you will. There's a __*vision*__ :
- **IMF/** — the IMPOSSIBLE MODULES FOLDER...
    - **\_\_init\_\_** — he's a snitch... not stitch... he tells py that it's a module folder. 
    - **hunt** — the leader of every IMF modules. Backbone of every CLI programs in this repo.
    - **rachel** — high on fashion, she styles text... 
- **CASE** — he runs b/w character CASEs. he's 90% honest... i mean accurate... 
- **Crypt** — he's just a simple (game) CLI based cipher... converter.
- **RPSLS** — simple rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock... game (CLI).

### PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME SAY:
>Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you, not anymore. GAME OVER!
